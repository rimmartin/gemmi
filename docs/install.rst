Installation
============

.. highlight:: none

C++ library
-----------

It is a header-only library. You need to ensure that
the ``include`` directory is in your include path
when compiling your program. For example::

    git clone https://github.com/project-gemmi/gemmi.git
    c++ -Igemmi/include -O2 my_program.cpp

If you want Gemmi to uncompress gzipped files on the fly
(i.e. if you ``#include <gemmi/gz.hpp>``)
you will also need to link your program with the zlib library.

If a file name is passed to Gemmi (through ``std::string``)
it is assumed to be in ASCII or UTF-8.

.. _install_py:

Python module
---------------------

From PyPI
~~~~~~~~~

To install the gemmi module do::

    pip install gemmi

We have binary wheels for several Python versions (for all supported CPython
versions and one PyPy version), so the command usually downloads binaries.
If a matching wheel is not available,
the module is compiled from source -- it takes several minutes
and requires a C++ compiler.

Other binaries
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you use the `CCP4 suite <https://www.ccp4.ac.uk/>`_,
you can find gemmi there.

If you use Anaconda Python, you can install
`package conda <https://github.com/conda-forge/gemmi-feedstock>`_
from conda-forge::

    conda install -c conda-forge gemmi

These distribution channels may have an older version of gemmi.

From git
~~~~~~~~

The latest version can be installed directly from the repository.
Either use::

    pip install git+https://github.com/project-gemmi/gemmi.git

or clone the `project <https://github.com/project-gemmi/gemmi/>`_
(or download a zip file) and from the top-level directory do::

    pip install .

On Windows Python should automatically find an appropriate compiler (MSVC).
If the compiler is not installed, pip shows a message with a download link.

If gemmi is already installed, uninstall the old version first
(``pip uninstall``) or add option ``--upgrade``.

Setuptools compile only one unit at a time and the whole process
takes several minutes. To make it faster, build in parallel with CMake.
Clone the project and do::

    cmake -D USE_PYTHON=1 .
    make -j4 py

Fortran and C bindings
----------------------

The Fortran bindings are in early stage and are not documented yet.
They use the ISO_C_BINDING module introduced in Fortran 2003.
You may see the ``fortran/`` directory to know what to expect.
The bindings and usage examples can be compiled with CMake::

    cmake -D USE_FORTRAN=1 .
    make

The C bindings are used only for making Fortran bindings,
but they should be usable on their own.
If you use cmake to build the project
you get a static library ``libcgemmi.a`` that can be used from C,
together with the :file:`fortran/*.h` headers.

Program
-------

The library comes with a command-line program also named ``gemmi``.

Binaries
~~~~~~~~

Binaries are distributed with the CCP4 suite and with Global Phasing software.
They are also included in
`conda-forge packages <https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/gemmi/files>`_.

The very latest builds (as well as a little older ones)
can be downloaded from CI jobs:

- for Windows --
  click the first (green) job in
  `AppVeyor CI <https://ci.appveyor.com/project/wojdyr/gemmi>`_
  and find gemmi.exe in the Artifacts tab,
- for Linux and Mac -- sign in to GitHub (no special permissions are needed,
  but GitHub requires sign-in for artifacts),
  click the first job (with âœ…) in
  `GitHub Actions <https://github.com/project-gemmi/gemmi/actions/workflows/ci.yml>`_
  and download a zip file from the Artifacts section.

From source
~~~~~~~~~~~

To build it from source, first make sure you have git, cmake and C++ compiler
installed (on Ubuntu: ``sudo apt install git cmake make g++``), then::

    git clone https://github.com/project-gemmi/gemmi.git
    cd gemmi
    cmake .
    make

Testing
-------

The main automated tests are in Python::

    python3 -m unittest discover -v tests/

We also have doctest tests in the documentation, and some others.
All of them can be run from the ``run-tests.sh`` script in the repository.
